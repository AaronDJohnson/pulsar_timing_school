# Pulsar Timing Data Analysis
This repository contains several exercises and explanatory Jupyter notebooks that detail basic frequentist and Bayesian statistical techniques, pulsar residual and noise modeling, and Gravitational Wave (GW) detection methods. The repository will be updated as new learning material is made available through student workshops and various busyweeks.

## Literature


Here we store several important papers in several different areas of pulsar timing data analysis. While this list is by no means exhaustive it gives a very good introduction to several areas of pulsar data analysis and modeling. The reading lists have been broken into broad topics:

1. [Ph.D theses on gravitational wave and pulsar data analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/literature/phd_theses)
2. [Data analysis and sampling techniques](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/literature/data_analysis)
3. [Pulsar noise modeling and analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/literature/noise)
4. [Non-linear Bayesian pulsar timing](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/literature/bayesian_timing)
5. [Stochastic gravitational wave background analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/literature/stochastic)
6. [Continuous gravitational wave analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/literature/cw)
7. [Gravitational wave burst analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/literature/bursts)

## Materials

Here we host a collection of exercises, notes and, presentations from various schools and workshops dedicated to pulsar timing data analysis. Each page will contain a complete description of it's contents in the README.

* [Basic data analysis methods](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/materials/nano_studentworkshop): Here we host materials used in several IPTA and NANOGrav schools. In this repository we cover basic frequentist and Bayesian data analysis techniques as well as some basic GW signal modeling theory.

* [Pulsar timing data analysis basics](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/materials/pulsar_data_analysis): In this repository we host a Jupyter notebook with an extensive explanaion of the noise modeling and Bayesian data analysis formulation that is used in nearly all modern pulsar timing analysis. This is an excellent place to start for new students that are already familiar with linear algebra and basic Bayesian data analysis concepts.

* [Pulsar timing noise modeling and GW detection exercises](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/new-design/materials/cit-busyweek): In this repository we host material from an intensive school held at Caltech that begins with basic Markov Chain Monte-Carlo design and gradually builds a fully functional GW detection pipeline from scratch. If you are already familiar with Bayesian data analysis, are comfortable with the Python programming language, and want to get your hands dirty and learn a lot, then this is the place to go.
