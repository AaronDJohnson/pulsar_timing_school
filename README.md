# Pulsar Timing Data Analysis
This repository contains several exercises and explanatory Jupyter notebooks that detail basic frequentist and Bayesian statistical techniques, pulsar residual and noise modeling, and Gravitational Wave (GW) detection methods. The repository will be updated as new learning material is made available through student workshops and various busyweeks.
