# Literature

Here we store several important papers in several different areas of pulsar timing data analysis. While this list is by no means exhaustive it gives a very good introduction to several areas of pulsar data analysis and modeling. The reading lists have been broken into broad topics:

1. [Ph.D theses on gravitational wave and pulsar data analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/master/literature/phd_theses)
2. [Data analysis and sampling techniques](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/master/literature/data_analysis)
3. [Pulsar noise modeling and analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/master/literature/noise)
4. [Non-linear Bayesian pulsar timing](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/master/literature/bayesian_timing)
5. [Stochastic gravitational wave background analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/master/literature/stochastic)
6. [Continuous gravitational wave analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/master/literature/cw)
7. [Gravitational wave burst analysis](https://github.com/nanograv/cit-busyweek/tree/master/literature/bursts)
