# Literature

Here we store several important papers in several different areas of pulsar timing data analysis. While this list is by no means exhaustive it gives a very good introduction to several areas of pulsar data analysis and modeling. The reading lists have been broken into broad topics:

## Ph.D theses on gravitational wave and pulsar data analysis

The Ph.D theses here are all focused on various aspects of pulsar timing 
and GW detection and modeling. While they are, of course, very long and 
detailed they provide a complete basis of nearly all modern pulsar timing 
and GW analysis techniques and theory.
