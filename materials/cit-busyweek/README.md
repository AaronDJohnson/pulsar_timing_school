# CIT busyweek materials

The busyweek at Caltech focused on building a complete gravitational wave detection pipeline using the same methods as real cutting-edge analysis. To complete the exercises one will need a proficient understanding of Python and linear algebra. Once you complete these exercises you should have a firm grasp on the theory and practice of modern data anslysis pipelines. The contents are as follows:

* [day1](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/edit/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day1/): Introduction to markov chain monte-carlo (MCMC) and writing your own sampler.
* [day2](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/edit/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day2/): Introduction to pulsar timing noise modeling and writing code for pulsar timing noise analysis.
* [day3](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/edit/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day3/): Introduction to continuous gravitational waves (CWs) and writing code for GW analysis of CWs.
* [day4](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/edit/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day4/): Introduction to isotropic and anisotropic stochastic GW backgrounds and writing code for stochastic background analysis
* [day5](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/edit/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day5/): Introduction and tutorials of pulsar timing analysis codes [PAL2](https://github.com/jellis18/PAL2), [piccard](https://github.com/vhaasteren/piccard), and [NX01](https://github.com/stevertaylor/NX01).
