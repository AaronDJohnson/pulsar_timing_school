# Day 2: Introduction to pulsar noise modeling

In this module you will design your own data anslysis pipeline for modeling pulsar timing noise. 

* [notes.pdf](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day2/notes.pdf): Hand written notes detailing the likelihood function used for pulsar timing noise modeling. A more advanced version of this can be found [here](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/pulsar_data_analysis/pulsar_timing_demo.ipynb) as well.
* [day2.ipynb](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day2/day2.ipynb): Jupyter notebook with various exercies for building and using noise analysis pipeline
* [day2-solutions.ipynb](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day2/day2-solutions.ipynb): Solutions to notebook exercies.
* [Generate Datasets.ipynb](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day2/Generate%20Datasets.ipynb): Jupyter notebook to generate datasets used in exercises. The datasets are already available in the `partim` and `signals` folders but this notebook could be useful as learning material.
* [simple_mcmc.py](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/cit-busyweek/day2/simple_mcmc.py): Python model for simple MCMC sampler.
