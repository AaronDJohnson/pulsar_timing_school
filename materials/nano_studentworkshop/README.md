# NANOGrav student workshop materials

This material is from a NANOGrav student workshop dedicated to GW modeling and data analysis. The exercises and notes here are meant to introduce new students to the basics of frequentist and Bayesian data anslysis methods, simple MCMC and nested sampling samplers, and gravitational wave background theory. The contents are as follows:

* [data_analysis.pdf](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/nano_studentworkshop/data_analysis.pdf): A presentation that goes over frequentist and Bayesian data anslysis techniques.
* [derive_smbhb_spec.pdf](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/nano_studentworkshop/derive_smbhb_spec.pdf): Exercise meant to describe the process by which a stochastic background is formed.
* [derive_smbhb_spec_solutions.pdf](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/nano_studentworkshop/derive_smbhb_spec_solutions.pdf): Solutions to the above exercise.
* [worsheet.ipynb](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/nano_studentworkshop/worksheet.ipynb): Several data anslysis exercises with detailed explanations in Jupyter notebook format.
* [worksheet_solutions.ipynb](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/nano_studentworkshop/worksheet_solutions.ipynb): Full solutions to the above exercises.
* [simple_mcmc.py](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/nano_studentworkshop/simple_mcmc.py): Python code for a simple MCMC sampler that will be used with exercises.
* [worksheet_utils.py](https://github.com/nanograv/pulsar_timing_school/blob/master/materials/nano_studentworkshop/worksheet_utils): Python library of several functions needed to complete the exercises.
