# Pulsar timing data analysis 

This Jupyter notebook has extensive text and some explanatory code that will introduce new students to the intricacies of pulsar timing data analysis using Gaussian process methods. There are no exercises here but if one fully comprehends this notebook then you are well on your way to becoming a pulsar timing data analysis expert.

**Note**: This notebook is still under construction and will soon contain more explanatory notes on gravitational wave detection
